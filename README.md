### Hi there 👋

📊 Transitioning from Mortgage Loan Officer & Secondary Marketing Analyst to Data Analyst
With a strong background in the financial services industry, I'm embarking on a journey to bridge
the world of mortgage lending with the power of data analysis. My career as a Mortgage Loan
Officer equipped me with a deep understanding of financial markets, credit risk assessment, and
customer service. Now, I'm channeling that expertise into the field of data analysis.

I’m a detail-oriented mortgage loan officer & secondary marketing analyst with over 10 years of experience in the mortgage industry. My ability to navigate complex situations allows me to provide clients with creative solutions that meet their requirements accurately and in a timely manner. I expertly manage mortgage pipelines and resolve issues related to locked loans and investor requirements, having closed on over 800 residential mortgage loans with an approximate value of $250M throughout my career. I’m a U.S. Navy veteran with a Bachelor of Science in business with a concentration in management.

🏆 Key Achievements:
• As secondary marketing analyst, I applied strong written and oral communication skills to effectively collaborate with over 100 loan officers in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment, ensuring that loans progressed through the pipeline on schedule.
• Analyzed reports to monitor rate locks, loan fallout, loan pipeline, and pricing. 
• Locked loans directly with investors. Evaluated current lock methods and recommended improvements, addressing market volatility that was affecting deal profitability.
• Monitored compliance of locked loans to investor guidelines and organizational policies. Resolved noncompliance issues by finding an investor that would best fit the requirements.
• Closed on over 800 residential mortgage loans with an approximate value of $250M throughout career as a mortgage loan officer.
